## DocumentGPT

Legal. DocumentGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that quickly and accurately identifies and organizes documents full of medical and other complicated terms, and then makes them available to the user.
With the DocumentGPT chatbot, you can have the AI read your documents (.txt, .pdf, .docx, etc.) thoroughly and answer questions about them with precision.

## PrivateGPT

A task that focuses on security issues such as leaking company secrets. Create a private GPT.

- This is a chatbot similar to DocumentGPT, but using a local language model to handle private data. The data is stored on your computer, so it can be used offline. You can entrust PrivateGPT with the data you need without worrying about leaks and increase your work productivity.

## QuizGPT

Want to learn what you need to memorize efficiently?

This is an app that lets you train an AI on content you need to learn, such as documents or Wikipedia, and then generates quizzes based on it. It minimizes the hassle and maximizes learning efficiency, which is especially useful for exams and short-term, high-efficiency learning.

## SiteGPT

Hiring CS staff because of the FAQs...? Let's cut costs by 2x with SiteGPT.

It's a chatbot that scrapes your website to collect content, cites the source, and answers relevant questions. You'll dramatically reduce the amount of time you spend on simple information walkthroughs that make up the majority of your customer interactions, and your customers will get the right information quickly, regardless of the hours your CS staff is available.

## MeetingGPT

Let MeetingGPT organize your meeting minutes!

It's an app that extracts audio, collects content, and summarizes and writes meeting minutes based on the meeting video. It prevents you from missing meetings because you're trying to record them, and it also allows you to ask relevant questions, so you can manage and utilize your minutes much more efficiently than just recording them.

## InvestorGPT

Let AI do the research for you.

It's an autonomous agent that can search the internet and use third-party APIs.
